# recipesProject
Project created for undecided. It asks user what is available in kitchen and proposes all possible recipes that are having the minimum of 4 of those ingredients. It uses .csv file to store data (as this is simple project i did not decide to go with sqlite or any other DB). 
As of now this is only terminal program which will be translated for user friendly application. 

I am adding this line for test
